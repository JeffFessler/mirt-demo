# mirt-demo

Collection of
Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the image reconstruction capabilities
of
[MIRT.jl](https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRT.jl),
the Julia version of the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox.

You can test drive any of these Jupyter notebooks
in a browser
without installing any local software
by using the free service at

by clicking on the binder badges below:

* Basic introduction:

Here is an example of the kind of image produced by one of the demos
![phantom-image](/figure/isbi-19-recon1.png?raw=true "phantom image")

This software was developed at the University of Michigan 
by 
[Jeff Fessler](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler)
and his 
[group](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/group).
